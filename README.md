# Gogle - Versatile site!

## Who are we?
This is a versatile site with a lot of interesting things... Want to see what YouTube looked like in 2012 and 2013, please. Want to download Sparta Remix veg files or something? you are welcome... Do you want to read the news of the city of Sosisonsk or the WIKI of the series Sosiska TIME? Come on in, dear guests... We even have a collection of old versions of Pixel Gun 3D. The site is updated quite often, new sections are created and old ones are changed, so come here often...

## Where should I go?
We have a lot... You can visit my 2012 styled YouTube channel or download the VEG files of my designs. There is a music player, my series wiki (early beta), a collection of Pixel Gun 3D. And if you get tired of all this, you can visit the sites of other people or companies through the banners below.

## Can I see what is currently in development?
Certainly! On the main page, click the settings icon, then enable beta content. Keep in mind that the sections there may be very crooked, there may simply be no beta features, and the pages may even be in their infancy and translate to 404.

## I want to add something!
To suggest an idea for a new section, you can try to write to me on social networks or in chat gramsk.ru
