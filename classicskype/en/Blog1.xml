			<description>Welcome to revision 3 of the Skype Classic Website section!

New functionality
      The entire section has been reworked: the iframe has been reworked
      Now you can leave a friend a link to the exact page you need, and not the entire site as a whole
      Each section page has its own icon in the title
      Each page of the section has a sound when entering. Keep this in mind when accessing the site late at night.
      Removed outdated sections of the site
      New thanks window
      News: learn about the new functionality of the skype classic section and theme
      Skype Lite client 1.88 for Android
      Selecting a Profile Design
      Setting a custom profile background (temporarily only for &#8220;honored users&#8221;, in the future it may be available to everyone)</description>
